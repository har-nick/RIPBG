# RIPBG
A hastily made RARBG searcher - made with 2004content's [rarbg](https://github.com/2004content/rarbg) magnet backups.

## IMPORTANT
This can run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. However I only have a Linux PC, so cannot build binaries for other OS.

## How to build
1) Clone this repo
2) Open the repo in IntelliJ IDEA. Make sure you have [Compose Multiplatform IDE Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16541-compose-multiplatform-ide-support) installed!
3) Run the project titled "PackageForCurrentOS"
4) The log will show a file path for the release JAR

## Why use this over (insert shady or crappy website here)?
Because websites get hugged to death, or are ran by idiots/scammers/idiot scammers.

## Will this stay up forever and ever and ever?
As long as the source files are available. Everything is ephemeral. Everybody dies.

## What's planned next?
Caching, and a slightly less awful UI. When I can be bothered.
